   - `start video`: Starts video recording (placeholder).
   - `stop video`: Stops video recording (placeholder).

3. **Network and Connectivity:**
   - `enable wifi`: Enables Wi-Fi connectivity.
   - `disable wifi`: Disables Wi-Fi connectivity.
   - `get network status`: Displays network status.
   - `scan for devices`: Scans for connected devices.

4. **Application Management:**

   - `close application`: Closes a specified application.

5. **Night Mode and Settings:**
   - `enable night mode`: Enables night mode.
   - `disable night mode`: Disables night mode.

6. **Alarm Management:**
   - `set alarm`: Sets an alarm for a specified time.
   - `clear alarms`: Clears all alarms.

7. **Facial Recognition and Tracking:**
   - `add new face`: Adds a new face to the recognition dataset.
   - `remove face`: Removes a face from the recognition dataset.
   - `list known faces`: Lists all known faces in the dataset.
   - `update face data`: Updates facial data for a specific face.
   - `start face tracking`: Starts face tracking (placeholder).
   - `stop face tracking`: Stops face tracking (placeholder).
   - `enable face detection`: Enables face detection (placeholder).
   - `disable face detection`: Disables face detection (placeholder).
   - `get face tracking status`: Displays current face tracking status (placeholder).
   - `reset face data`: Resets all facial recognition data.

### Features and Functions:

1. **Login and Security:**
   - Secure login using password authentication and voice command verification.
   - In case of incorrect password attempts:
     - Secure system by editing and deleting script files.
     - Shutdown the system after securing.

2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Integration:**
   - Uses BERT for natural language understanding and command prediction.
   - Predicts user commands based on input using BERT model.

3. **Facial Recognition:**
   - `capture_image()`: Captures an image from the webcam.
   - `verify_user(image, known_faces)`: Verifies user identity using facial recognition.
   - `add_face(name, image)`: Adds a new face to the dataset (placeholder).
   - `remove_face(name)`: Removes a face from the dataset (placeholder).
   - `list_faces()`: Lists all known faces in the dataset.
   - `update_face_data(name, image)`: Updates facial data for a specific face (placeholder).

4. **Face Tracking and Detection:**
   - `start_face_tracking()`: Placeholder function to start face tracking.
   - `stop_face_tracking()`: Placeholder function to stop face tracking.
   - `enable_face_detection()`: Placeholder function to enable face detection.
   - `disable_face_detection()`: Placeholder function to disable face detection.
   - `get_face_tracking_status()`: Placeholder function to get face tracking status.

5. **AI Module (`ai.py`):**
   - `initialize_bert()`: Initializes BERT model and tokenizer.
   - `predict_command(command, model, tokenizer, commands_list)`: Predicts the user command using BERT model.

### Placeholder Functions:

The following functions are currently placeholders (marked with `(placeholder)`) and need to be implemented with specific logic or functionality:

- `start recording`
- `stop recording`
- `start video`
- `stop video`
- `add_face(name, image)`
- `remove_face(name)`
- `update_face_data(name, image)`
- `start face tracking`
- `stop face tracking`
- `enable face detection`
- `disable face detection`
- `get face tracking status`

### Notes:

- Ensure proper integration of facial recognition and AI modules (`ai.py` and `functions.py`) with command execution (`commands.py`).
- Implement error handling and validation for user inputs, especially in functions related to file operations and system commands.
- Customize the script further based on specific requirements and additional features desired.

This structured approach provides clarity on the current functionality and highlights areas where additional development or integration is needed to complete the script's intended capabilities. Adjustments can be made as per specific project requirements and future enhancements.
